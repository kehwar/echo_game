# Sound Files

These sound files are used for game feedback and timer alerts.

## Files:
- tick.mp3: Short tick sound played during last 10 seconds of timer
- finish.mp3: Sound played when the round ends
- correct.mp3: Sound played when marking a card as correct
- pass.mp3: Sound played when skipping/passing a card

## Note:
Sound files should be short (< 1 second for feedback, < 2 seconds for finish) and optimized for web playback.
