# 🎮 Echo Game - Game Flow Instructions

This document describes how the game loop works in Echo Game, a phone-on-forehead charades game.

## Game Loop Overview

The game follows a simple 4-step flow that repeats for each round:

### 1. **Select Deck** 🎨

- Players start at the home page where they can choose from 7 different decks
- Available decks include: Animals, Actions & Activities, Food & Drinks, Professions, Sports & Games, Objects & Things, and Movies & Entertainment
- Each deck has its own set of cards tailored to that category
- Click/tap on a deck card to proceed to the game setup screen

### 2. **Press Start & Place on Forehead** 📱

- After selecting a deck, players see the game setup screen
- Review the quick instructions displayed on screen
- Press the **"START GAME"** button to begin
- **Immediately place the phone on your forehead** facing outward so other players can see the screen
- The game starts a 2-minute countdown timer automatically
- The first card appears on the screen for others to see (you won't be able to see it)

### 3. **Listen to Hints & Tap to Score** 🎭

During active gameplay:

- **Your friends give you hints** about the card displayed on the screen
- **Listen carefully** to their clues and try to guess the card
- **Tap the LEFT side of the screen** when you successfully guess the card correctly ✓
  - This marks the card as correct
  - Increases your correct count
  - Shows the next card
- **Tap the RIGHT side of the screen** to pass/skip a difficult card ✗
  - This marks the card as skipped
  - Increases your skip count
  - Shows the next card
- **Continue guessing** cards until the 2-minute timer runs out
- The timer and current score are displayed at the top of the screen (visible to your friends)

### 4. **Check Score & Results** 🏆

When the timer reaches zero:

- The game automatically ends
- You'll see the **results screen** with your final scores:
  - **Correct Guesses**: Number of cards you guessed correctly (shown in green)
  - **Skipped Cards**: Number of cards you passed on (shown in red)
- From the results screen, you can:
  - **Play Again**: Start a new round with the same deck
  - **Choose Different Deck**: Return to the deck selection screen to pick a different category

## Game Mechanics

- **Timer**: Each round lasts exactly **2 minutes (120 seconds)**
- **Card Selection**: Cards are randomly shuffled from the selected deck
- **Card Recycling**: If you go through all cards in a deck before time runs out, the cards are reshuffled and recycled
- **No Network Required**: The game runs entirely locally on your device - no internet connection needed during gameplay
- **Tap Zones**: The entire left half of the screen is the "Correct" zone, and the entire right half is the "Skip" zone, making it easy to tap without looking

## Tips for Best Gameplay

1. **Make sure your phone brightness is up** so your friends can clearly see the cards
2. **Hold the phone steady** against your forehead for easier reading
3. **Don't peek!** The game is more fun when you genuinely don't know the card
4. **Give clear hints** - players giving clues should avoid saying the card or obvious rhymes
5. **Have fun** and don't worry too much about the score - it's all about having a good time!
